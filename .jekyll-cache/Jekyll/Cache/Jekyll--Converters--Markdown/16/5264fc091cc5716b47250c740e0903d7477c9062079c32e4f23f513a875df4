I"ƒ<p>I recently came across CanCLIDâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/CanCLID/inject-jyutping">Inject Jyutping</a> browser extension. The basic idea is to annotate Chinese characters with the associated Cantonese pronunciation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyutping">jyutping</a>, the <em>de facto</em> standard romanization for Cantonese in academia and education. However, I unfortunately found it difficult to use due to an often-cited issue with Jyutping, which is that it uses numbers to represent tones, causing a high degree of clutter and excessive spacing between characters which can make the original text hard to read.</p>
